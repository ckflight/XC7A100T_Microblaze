2. REPORT DETAILS

PDRC-34#1 Error
MMCM_adv_ClkFrequency_div_no_dclk  
The computed value 525.000 MHz (CLKIN1_PERIOD, net pll_clk3) for the VCO operating frequency of the MMCME2_ADV site MMCME2_ADV_X1Y1 (cell u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/gen_mmcm.mmcm_i) falls outside the operating range of the MMCM VCO frequency for this device (600.000 - 1200.000 MHz). The computed value is (CLKFBOUT_MULT_F * 1000 / (CLKINx_PERIOD * DIVCLK_DIVIDE)). Please run update_timing to update the MMCM settings. If that does not work, adjust either the input period CLKINx_PERIOD (13.333333), multiplication factor CLKFBOUT_MULT_F (7.000000) or the division factor DIVCLK_DIVIDE (1), in order to achieve a VCO frequency within the rated operating range for this device.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-43#1 Error
PLL_adv_ClkFrequency_div_no_dclk  
The computed value 600.000 MHz (CLKIN1_PERIOD, net SYSCLK_IBUF_BUFG) for the VCO operating frequency of the PLLE2_ADV site PLLE2_ADV_X1Y1 (cell u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i) falls outside the operating range of the PLL VCO frequency for this device (800.000 - 1600.000 MHz). The computed value is (CLKFBOUT_MULT_F * 1000 / (CLKINx_PERIOD * DIVCLK_DIVIDE)). Please adjust either the input period CLKINx_PERIOD (10.000000), multiplication factor CLKFBOUT_MULT_F (6) or the division factor DIVCLK_DIVIDE (1), in order to achieve a VCO frequency within the rated operating range for this device.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-46#1 Critical Warning
v7v8_mmcm_fvco_rule1  
The current computed target frequency, FVCO, is out of range for cell u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/gen_mmcm.mmcm_i. The computed FVCO is 525.000 MHz. The valid FVCO range for speed grade -1 is 600MHz to 1200MHz. The cell attribute values used to compute FVCO are CLKFBOUT_MULT_F = 7.000, CLKIN1_PERIOD = 13.33333, and DIVCLK_DIVIDE = 1 (FVCO = 1000 * CLKFBOUT_MULT_F/(CLKIN1_PERIOD * DIVCLK_DIVIDE)).
This violation may be corrected by:
  1. The timer uses timing constraints for clock period or clock frequency that affect CLKIN1 to set cell attribute CLKIN1_PERIOD, over-riding any previous value. This may already be in place and, if so this violation will be resolved once Timing is run.  Otherwise, consider modifying timing constraints to adjust the CLKIN1_PERIOD and bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  2. In the absence of timing constraints that affect CLKIN1, consider modifying the cell CLKIN1_PERIOD to bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  3. If CLKIN1_PERIOD is satisfactory, modify the CLKFBOUT_MULT_F or DIVCLK_DIVIDE cell attributes to bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  4. The MMCM configuration may be dynamically modified by use of DRP which is recognized by an ACTIVE signal on DCLK pin.

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-6#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Invalid constraint on register microblaze/microblaze_i/axi_quad_spi_0/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/IO0_I_REG. It has the property IOB=TRUE, but it is not driving or driven by any IO element.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-6#2 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Invalid constraint on register microblaze/microblaze_i/axi_quad_spi_1/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/IO0_I_REG. It has the property IOB=TRUE, but it is not driving or driven by any IO element.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1617#1 Warning
use_IOB_register  
The FDRE cell microblaze/microblaze_i/axi_quad_spi_0/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/IO0_I_REG has IOB set to TRUE, but does not connect directly to an IO cell. Remove the constraint or ensure the FDRE is properly connected to an IO.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1617#2 Warning
use_IOB_register  
The FDRE cell microblaze/microblaze_i/axi_quad_spi_1/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/IO0_I_REG has IOB set to TRUE, but does not connect directly to an IO cell. Remove the constraint or ensure the FDRE is properly connected to an IO.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>
